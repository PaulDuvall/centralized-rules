Parse skill-rules.json and extract all keywords from:\n   - keywordMappings.base (testing, security, git, refactoring, architecture, metrics, development, beads)\n   - keywordMappings.languages (python, typescript, javascript, go, rust, java + their frameworks)\n   - keywordMappings.cloud (aws, azure, gcp, vercel)\n   - intentPatterns (regex patterns for user intent)\n   - fileContextTriggers (file pattern triggers)\n\n2. Test runner should:\n   - Randomly select N keywords (configurable, default: 10)\n   - For each keyword, simulate a prompt containing that keyword\n   - Verify the hook script correctly identifies and loads the expected rules\n   - Track which rule categories were triggered\n   - Report success/failure with detailed output\n\n3. Test scenarios:\n   - Single keyword triggers correct rule\n   - Multiple keywords trigger multiple rules (e.g., 'pytest fastapi' -\u003e testing + python + fastapi)\n   - Slash commands trigger correct rules (e.g., '/xtest' -\u003e testing-philosophy)\n   - File context triggers work (.test.py -\u003e testing-philosophy + python)\n   - Intent patterns match correctly ('write tests for' -\u003e testing)\n   - Edge cases: case insensitivity, partial matches, exclusion patterns\n\n4. Implementation options:\n   - Shell script in scripts/test-keyword-validation.sh\n   - Or Python script for better JSON handling\n   - Can use shuf/random for selection, jq for JSON parsing\n   - Mock the hook environment for isolated testing\n\n5.

Add `detect_ai_tools()` function to sync-ai-rules.sh\n2. Update sync logic to use detected tools by default\n3. Add verbose output showing which tools were auto-detected\n4. Update documentation and usage examples\n5.
