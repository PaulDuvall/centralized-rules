{"id":"centralized-rules-kv1","title":"Create automated test for random keyword search validation from skill-rules.json","description":"**Goal:** Implement automated tests that randomly select keywords from skill-rules.json and verify centralized-rules activates correctly for each keyword.\n\n**Test Design:**\n1. Parse skill-rules.json and extract all keywords from:\n   - keywordMappings.base (testing, security, git, refactoring, architecture, metrics, development, beads)\n   - keywordMappings.languages (python, typescript, javascript, go, rust, java + their frameworks)\n   - keywordMappings.cloud (aws, azure, gcp, vercel)\n   - intentPatterns (regex patterns for user intent)\n   - fileContextTriggers (file pattern triggers)\n\n2. Test runner should:\n   - Randomly select N keywords (configurable, default: 10)\n   - For each keyword, simulate a prompt containing that keyword\n   - Verify the hook script correctly identifies and loads the expected rules\n   - Track which rule categories were triggered\n   - Report success/failure with detailed output\n\n3. Test scenarios:\n   - Single keyword triggers correct rule\n   - Multiple keywords trigger multiple rules (e.g., 'pytest fastapi' -\u003e testing + python + fastapi)\n   - Slash commands trigger correct rules (e.g., '/xtest' -\u003e testing-philosophy)\n   - File context triggers work (.test.py -\u003e testing-philosophy + python)\n   - Intent patterns match correctly ('write tests for' -\u003e testing)\n   - Edge cases: case insensitivity, partial matches, exclusion patterns\n\n4. Implementation options:\n   - Shell script in scripts/test-keyword-validation.sh\n   - Or Python script for better JSON handling\n   - Can use shuf/random for selection, jq for JSON parsing\n   - Mock the hook environment for isolated testing\n\n5. CI Integration:\n   - Add to .github/workflows/ci.yml\n   - Run on every PR and push to main\n   - Generate coverage report of tested keywords\n   - Fail if any keyword mapping is broken\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n- [ ] Test script created and documented\n- [ ] Covers all keyword categories in skill-rules.json\n- [ ] Random selection ensures broad coverage over time\n- [ ] CI integration with clear failure messages\n- [ ] Reports which keywords passed/failed\n- [ ] Can be run locally for debugging\n\n**Files to modify:**\n- scripts/test-keyword-validation.sh (new)\n- .github/workflows/ci.yml (add test job)\n- skill-rules.json (ensure testability)\n\n**Why this matters:** Ensures centralized-rules reliably activates for all documented keywords, preventing silent failures when keywords are added/changed.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-21T12:00:00-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-21T09:05:53.531444-05:00","closed_at":"2025-12-21T09:05:53.531444-05:00","close_reason":"Implemented in commit 4edcc95 - test script created with CI integration"}
