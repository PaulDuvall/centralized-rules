Add `detect_ai_tools()` function to sync-ai-rules.sh\n2. Update sync logic to use detected tools by default\n3. Add verbose output showing which tools were auto-detected\n4. Update documentation and usage examples\n5.

Includes: (1) Progressive disclosure validation via scripts/validate-progressive-disclosure.sh including real project testing; (2) ShellCheck linting for all bash scripts with security checks; (3) Matrix testing across 7 project types (Python+FastAPI, TypeScript+React, Go+Gin, Python+Django+PostgreSQL, TypeScript+Next.js+AWS, Go+Gin+AWS+Docker, Multi-language Python+TypeScript); (4) Documentation verification (README, ARCHITECTURE, markdown files, internal links); (5) All-tests-passed summary job. Validates AGENTS.md generation, progressive disclosure warnings, rule directory structure, and multi-language/framework/cloud detection. Artifacts retained for 5 days. Replaced scheduled testing approach with event-driven CI on every change.
